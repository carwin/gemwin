# Gemwin

_This is a mostly useless ruby gem used for educational purposes._

## How to use it

There's an executable file in the bin directory that accepts a "Language"
argument. Here's an example:

```
# You can add the executable to your $PATH, otherwise:
$ ./bin/gemwin spanish
```

Gemwin knows four languages!

  * english
  * japanese
  * pirate
  * dudebro
